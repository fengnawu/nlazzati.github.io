We develop a nonparametric approach to test for monotone behavior in optimizing
agents and to make out-of-sample predictions. Our approach could be applied to simultaneous
games with ordered actions, with agents playing pure strategy Nash equilibria or Bayesian
Nash equilibria. We require no parametric assumptions on payoff functions nor distributional
assumptions on the unobserved heterogeneity of agents. Multiplicity of optimal solutions (or
equilibria) is not excluded, and we are agnostic about how they are selected. To illustrate how
our approach works, we include an empirical application to an IO entry game.
